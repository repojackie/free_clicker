# free_clicker
Free/open source equivalent for clicker questions/attendance

# The Intentions
Most teachers use clicker questions for attendance and for in-class quizzes. Existing proprietary technology can be annoying for students with differing devices and who do not wish to pay recurring fees. 

This web-based application seeks to increase availability and ease of use for students and teachers alike via a simple interface.
