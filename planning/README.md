- Interested in maximizing scalability/ability to be built into phone applications and other stuff
- Simplicity/ease of use 

# Research
https://medium.com/hackervalleystudio/weekend-project-part-2-turning-flask-into-a-real-time-websocket-server-using-flask-socketio-ab6b45f1d896 -> For chat rooms with flask-socketio

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy_orm_building_relationship.htm -> For ORM

https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/flask-login/latest/flask-login.pdf -> for flask-login

https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/models/ -> for dealing with models and one-to-many relationships

# TO-DO
- Managing login - make it expandable so that university accounts may be used
- Modeling server-side database - how will we store the information?
- Each user has access to their account and can make their own sessions - ability to start/stop sessions modeled after flask chat rooms
- User can join available sessions and remember the person who initiated the sessions
